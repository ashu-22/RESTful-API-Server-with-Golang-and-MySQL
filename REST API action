REST API in action
Now build the program and run it.
$ go build gitter.go
$ ./gitter
API server will be running on http://localhost:3000
Get all persons
Get user with id = 28
Change name from "Sagar Juthuga" to "Sagar Kumar"
Delete user Vinay from persons list
You can actually observe the terminal where API server is running to get time taken by requests, type of request etc.
There are more things we need to implement to make it usable.
Logging
Authentication
