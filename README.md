# RESTful-API-Server-with-Golang-and-MySQL
 REST API is the common web service mechanism that we can find on any system. Using a web service, applications can talk with each other without directly asking for data from database. So in this article we are trying to make an attempt to build a basic RESTful API with Golang and MySQL. I here use an HTTP framework called Gin for creating an API server. Gin is faster because it is built on top of httprouter.
