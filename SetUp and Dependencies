We need Go compiler for running and building our API. So we hope Go, MySQL server are installed in your system. If not on Ubuntu14.04 machine you can do this

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/go
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install golang-stable
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Now set the $GOPATH variable creating a new folder in your home. $GOPATH is where your external packages and libraries are stored. My ~/.bashrc looks like this.

export GOPATH=/home/naren/mygo
export PATH=$PATH::/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

Now we are ready with setup. Let us install dependencies.

$ go get "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
$ go get "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

Now we have everything to proceed. For development chose your favorite text editor. My favorites are both Atom and Sublime Text 3. Both have very good tooling for Go.

A basic REST API has these four important methods.

1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE
